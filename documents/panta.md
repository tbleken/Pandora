## Your easy accessible testing area `Pandora.prg`  
`Pandora.prg` is initially an empty file. The purpose is to have *one* file to use during your development and testing. If the first line is `Return`, no harm is done if you accidentally "do" it.  

This file is also a perfect place to store your frequently used `Pandora` "commands"  


| You type:                |        Result after pressing `F8`                                |
|:-------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| . (dot)                  | Opens `Pandora.prg`  |
| , (comma)                | Same as above                              |

#### Note: This feature only works in the Command Window
