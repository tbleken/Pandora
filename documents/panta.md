## Your easy accessible testing area `Pandora.prg`  
`Pandora.prg` is initially an empty file. The purpose is to have *one* file to use during your development and testing. If the first line is `Return`, no harm is done if you accidentally "do" it.  

This file is also a perfect place to store your frequently used `Pandora` "commands"  

Update: You can now have more than one of these testing areas, all will have names that start with `Pandora`.
