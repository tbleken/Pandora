### 2023-10-5, Version 1.01 ###

Changed the syntax for the Dir commands, and in which window the different syntax versions can be used. 
Most important is the new DirX command and the shorter version,
\*\* and \*\*:. The latter and \*: can now also be used in all of VFP's editors.
A side effect is that some earlier command versions don't work anymore.

Document updated accordingly.

Corrected the documentation for Ins.

### 2023-10-2, Version 1.00 ###

#### First release of `Pandora` to go public!
